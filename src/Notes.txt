JavaFX GUI with two panes
	One displays the solar system and can hopefully be clicked on to select objects
	Other shows the details about the planet/moon being selected

Download JSON from online solar system api.
	Use this json data to draw the solar system on a canvas
	
Click EventHandler to update the right side pane with the data for the canvas item clicked on.
	
Save JSON to disk and automatically load it on program start.

Patterns n' Stuff
	Factory Pattern for creating different types of Celestial Bodies
	Maybe MVC?
		View = GUI
		Controller = Not quite sure.  Maybe the EventHandlers?
		Model = JSON Data
		
	Inheritance
		Celesial Body (Abstract)
			Sun
			Planet
			Moon
		
Maybe (Feature Creep)
	Give it a play button that lets you see the objects move in their orbits.
	This is kinda api dependent, unless I do the math myself.
	May just use something like average orbital velocity.
